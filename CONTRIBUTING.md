# Contributing to GitHub Analyzer

Thank you for contributing to GitHub Analyzer! Below you can find some core
guidelines for contributing to the project.

## Code of Conduct

Be kind and respectful to the members of the community. Take time to educate
others who are seeking help. Harassment of any kind will not be tolerated.

## Questions

If you have questions or ideas that are not a good fit for an issue
(i.e., not a feature request or bug) feel free to use the repository's [discussions](https://github.com/crashappsec/github-analyzer/discussions) to get feedback from the community and maintainers.

## Filing a bug or feature

1. When filing a bug or request, please check existing issues to see if there
   exist some issue capturing the same topic already.

1. When filing bugs, please provide as detailed steps of reproduction as possible.

## Submitting changes

1. You can submit changes via pull requests (PRs). PRs will only be getting reviewed
   once all lint and unit test steps are passing. We will do our best to reply
   to requests for reviews in a timely manner, however we cannot provide an SLA
   for reviews.

1. The current license will remain, and we might introduce a requirement for
   contributors to sign a CLA once the project matures.

### Sample Workflow

1. Ensure you have [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) installed as it will be used for formatting and linting during PRs
1. Fork the project in your account
1. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b your_handle/your-feature`)
1. Make changes and add them to staging (`git add .`)
1. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'a short description of your feature'`)
1. Push to your branch (`git push origin your_handle/your-feature`)
1. Create new pull request
