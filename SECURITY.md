## Supported Versions

This repository is still in a pre-alpha stage, therefore we expect to be
porting patches as soon as possible for any latest version, but no
long-term support for older versions is expected until we move to a major
release.

| Version  | Supported          |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please file an issue for any vulnerability you would like to report.
